### Description

This lab course will offer projects related to recent topics in (3D) geometry processing. For most this will mean implementing an existing baseline or algorithm and then improving one aspect of it. The topics this semester are: 

### Requirements

* There are no formal course requirements.
* All projects will be implemented in Python and prior experience is highly recommended. There will be no introduction to Python and the projects will be hard to complete while learning the language. 
* Prior experience with 3D geometric data is beneficial but not necessary. 

### Participation

* Topics can be worked on in groups of max. three students. Working in groups is recommended but the expected amount of work done increases with a bigger group size. 
* If you would like to participate, send an email to laehner at cs.uni-bonn.de until **February 14th** with your two ranked preferred topics, the names of your group members if you have any (everyone needs to send an email though) or if you are open to be assigned a group with free spots. 
* Groups and topics will be announced on February 15th.
* There will be (mostly in-person) office hours Tuesdays 10-12 (see Basis for the room) where you can get help with your project. Weekly attendance is not mandatory but there will be no meetings at other times/constant help via email so if you can never attend in this time slot, you are on your own. 
* You will be graded based on a final report and presentation done about your work (if what you did makes sense and is well presented/documented not necessarily if it also lead to good results). 
* The presentation will be 30min + 10 minutes questions.
* The final reports should be 10 pages (+ references) and use this [report template](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/courses).
